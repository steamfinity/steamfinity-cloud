At Steamfinity, we take security seriously and strive to keep our codebase secure and reliable. 
Steamfinity uses advanced end-to-end encryption to protect your Steam accounts credentials. 
However, as with any software, there is always a possibility of vulnerabilities and security issues.

We will review your report promptly and take appropriate action to address the issue.

Please note that any vulnerabilities that are reported publicly on GitHub or elsewhere may be subject to legal action.

Thank you for helping to keep Steamfinity safe and secure.
