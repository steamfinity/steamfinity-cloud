# Steamfinity Security Policy
At Steamfinity, we take security seriously and strive to keep our codebase secure and reliable. 
Steamfinity uses advanced end-to-end encryption to protect your Steam accounts credentials. 
However, as with any software, there is always a possibility of vulnerabilities and security issues. 
If you discover a security vulnerability in Steamfinity or Steamfinity Cloud, please do not post it as a public GitHub issue. 
Instead, please report the vulnerability directly to our security team at steamfinity@protonmail.com.

When reporting a vulnerability, please provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue and any relevant technical information. 
We will review your report promptly and take appropriate action to address the issue.

Please note that any vulnerabilities that are reported publicly on GitHub or elsewhere may be subject to legal action.

Thank you for helping to keep Steamfinity safe and secure.
